Hamburger Menu Issue Analysis:

From the screenshot, I can see:
1. The mobile menu is open and showing menu items overlaid on the page
2. The menu items (Home, Properties, How It Works, About, FAQ, Contact) are visible
3. There's also Login and Sign Up buttons visible
4. The menu appears to be showing BEHIND the main content or not properly styled
5. The footer text "© 2024 Emtelaak" and "Fractional Real Estate" is visible at the top
6. The menu items appear faded/transparent and overlapping with the page content

The issue seems to be:
- The slide-out menu is not properly positioned or has incorrect z-index
- The menu content is showing but not in the proper slide-out panel
- The backdrop might not be working correctly
